Floyd Warshall Algorithm pseudo code.

Input -> A weighted graph as an adjacency matrix
Output -> All pair shortest distance

Time Complexity -> O(V^3)
space Complexity -> O(V^2)

- create s distance matrix "d" where d[i][j] = x and where there is a direct edge from node "i" to node "j" and the cost is "x"

- for all node "i" d[i][i] = 0
- for all node "i" & "j" where there isn't any direct edge from i -> j, d[i][j] = infinity

- for all node "k"
    - for all node "u"
        - for all node "v"
            - d[u][v] = min(d[u][v], d[u][k]+d[k][v])

- Output all pair shortest distance "d" array
